Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose
objects into tree structures and then work with these
structures as if they were individual objects.

The Composite pattern lets you run a behavior recursively over all
components of an object tree.

Use the Composite pattern when you have to implement a
tree-like object structure.

Use the pattern when you want the client code to treat both
simple and complex elements uniformly.
