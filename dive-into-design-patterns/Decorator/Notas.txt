Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach
new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside
special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

Wearing clothes is an example of using decorators. When
you’re cold, you wrap yourself in a sweater. If you’re still cold
with a sweater, you can wear a jacket on top. If it’s raining, you
can put on a raincoat. All of these garments “extend” your basic
behavior but aren’t part of you, and you can easily take off any
piece of clothing whenever you don’t need it.

> Use the Decorator pattern when you need to be able to assign
extra behaviors to objects at runtime without breaking the
code that uses these objects.
