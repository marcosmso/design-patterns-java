Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy
existing objects without making your code dependent on
their classes.

The Prototype pattern delegates the cloning process to the
actual objects that are being cloned. The pattern declares a
common interface for all objects that support cloning. This
interface lets you clone an object without coupling your code
to the class of that object. Usually, such an interface contains
just a single clone method.

Use the Prototype pattern when your code shouldnâ€™t depend
on the concrete classes of objects that you need to copy.

Use the pattern when you want to reduce the number of subclasses
that only differ in the way they initialize their respective
objects. Somebody could have created these subclasses to
be able to create objects with a specific configuration.
(The Prototype pattern lets you use a set of pre-built objects,
configured in various ways, as prototypes.)

Prototype can help when you need to save copies of Commands
into history.
