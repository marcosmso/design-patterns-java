Mediator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you reduce
chaotic dependencies between objects. The pattern restricts
direct communications between the objects and forces them to
collaborate only via a mediator object.

Aircraft pilots donâ€™t talk to each other directly when deciding who gets to
land their plane next. All communication goes through the control tower.
