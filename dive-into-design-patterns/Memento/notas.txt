Memento is a behavioral design pattern that lets you save and
restore the previous state of an object without revealing the
details of its implementation.

The Memento pattern delegates creating the state snapshots
to the actual owner of that state, the originator object. Hence,
instead of other objects trying to copy the editor’s state from
the “outside,” the editor class itself can make the snapshot
since it has full access to its own state.

Use the Memento pattern when you want to produce snapshots
of the object’s state to be able to restore a previous state
of the object.
